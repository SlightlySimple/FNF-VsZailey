:zailey:Awful late at night for people like you to be wandering about...
:gf:I could say the same to you.
:zailey:I ain't like you. I'm MADE for the night.
:zailey:Besides, I need to be out here now. I'm looking for someone.
:gf:What are you looking for? An autograph?
:zailey:Not this time. I know what he's capable of, and I'm goin' after it!
:gf:Like you could. I doubt if you'd last half a minute.
:zailey:Wanna bet, hotshot? Just 'cause Mr. Blue Sky here has taken him once-
:gf:Twice, actually.
:zailey:-doesn't mean you're all that. But prove me wrong, I dare you.
