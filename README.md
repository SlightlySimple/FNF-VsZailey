## **NOTE: DO NOT REHOST THIS MOD.**
I've taken steps to prevent web builds of this mod from being compileable, and I'd like to keep the mod from being hosted on any websites other than the ones I choose.

## Friday Night Funkin'
**Friday Night Funkin'** is a rhythm game originally made for Ludum Dare 47 "Stuck In a Loop".

> Uh oh! Your tryin to kiss ur hot girlfriend, but her MEAN and EVIL dad is trying to KILL you! He's an ex-rockstar, the only way to get to his heart? The power of music... 

## Vs Zailey
While going for a casual stroll in the park (at midnight), you encounter Zailey, a woman who is such a big fan of Zardy that she's honed her skills in kicking your ass the same way he did.
She also has a cute plush of him.

Vs Zailey runs on **Kade Engine** which you can find [here](https://KadeDev.github.io/Kade-Engine/).

This mod was heavily inspired by the [Vs Zardy](https://gamejolt.com/games/vs-zardy/645944) mod and is not associated with any of it's creators.

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and will never be official, so don't get confused.
